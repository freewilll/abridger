- title: Extraction with the default relations
  description: By default, complete rows are fetched. This means that if a rule is added to fetch the department with name "Research" then rows referencing that department aren't fetched. This results in just one department being fetched and nothing else.
  config:
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: departments, column: name, values: Research}

- title: Extraction with a relation 1
  description: This does an extraction with a relation from `employees` to `departments`. This will include both employees in the research department.
  config:
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: departments, column: name, values: Research}
      - relations:
        - {table: employees, column: department_id}

- title: Extraction with a relation 2
  description: This does an extraction with the above relation, but with both departments. This ends up fetching all employees.
  config:
  - subject:
    - tables:
      - {table: departments, column: name, values: [Research, Accounting]}
    - relations:
      - {table: employees, column: department_id}

- title: Everything
  description: |
    This includes all relations. This leads to all employees in the research department being fetched since: |
    - John belongs to the research department
    - All employees in the research department are fetched, which pulls in Jane
  config:
    - relations:
        - { defaults: everything}
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: employees, column: name, values: John}

- title: Everything with --explain
  description: This runs the above extraction, but with the `--explain` option.
  config:
    - relations:
        - { defaults: everything}
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: employees, column: name, values: John}
  after-thought: The asterisks indicate stickyness. In this case stickiness isn't used, so only the subject has a *.
  explain: True
