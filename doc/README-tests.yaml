- title: Extraction with the default relations for a department
  description: By default, complete rows are fetched. This means that if a rule is added to fetch the department with name "Research" then rows referencing that department aren't fetched. This results in just one department being fetched and nothing else.
  config:
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: departments, column: name, values: Research}

- title: Extraction with a relation for a department
  description: This does an extraction with a relation from `employees` to `departments`. This will include both employees in the research department.
  config:
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: departments, column: name, values: Research}
      - relations:
        - {table: employees, column: department_id}

- title: Extraction with a relation for two departments
  description: This does an extraction with the above relation, but with both departments. This ends up fetching all employees.
  config:
  - subject:
    - tables:
      - {table: departments, column: name, values: [Research, Accounting]}
    - relations:
      - {table: employees, column: department_id}

- title: Extraction with a relation for an employee
  description: |
    This includes all relations. This leads to all employees in the research department being fetched since: |
    - John belongs to the research department
    - All employees in the research department are fetched, which pulls in Jane
  config:
    - relations:
        - { defaults: everything}
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: employees, column: name, values: John}

- title: Disabled relations
  description: |
    This demonstrates the blacklisting approach. All relations are included by default,
    however the relation from `employees` to `departments` is disabled.
    Fetching a department will therefore not fetch any of the employees.
    Relations can be disabled globally or per subject.
  config:
    - relations:
        - { defaults: everything}
    - subject:
      - tables:
        - {table: departments, column: name, values: Research}
      - relations:
        - {table: employees, column: department_id, disabled: true}
